I have not followed any particular style guide for this assignment. Just tried to improve the code quality in my own way.

There are a few errors in the code that I couldn't work out but they do not affect the functionality of the App and all the end points are working properly.

A couple of days before the deadline you told me on Teams that we are not supposed to use I18n in our assignment. I had already done it so didn't remove it as I didn't want to mess everything up two days before the deadline.

In the photo endpoint, the endpoint works properly. But on reviews without a photo it just prints an empty space. I tried but couldn't resolve the issue. But it doesn't affect the functionality of the photo endpoint.
